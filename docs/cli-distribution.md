# CLI/TUI distribution contract

Maka ships its CLI/TUI as a required artifact of the same product release as Desktop. Phase 1
publishes one signed and notarized Apple Silicon artifact:

`Maka-<version>-cli-mac-arm64.zip`

The ZIP contains an exactly pinned official Node runtime and the production workspace/npm
dependency closure derived from repository manifests and `package-lock.json`. It does not use a
system Node installation or a single-file/SEA build.

## Public contract

Only these surfaces are stable:

- `bin/maka`, including invocation through a symlink outside the extracted archive;
- the documented `RELEASE.json` fields below.

`libexec/**` is private and may change between releases. There is no public `maka-agent` launcher.
The TUI is the default interactive mode of `maka`, not a separate artifact.

`RELEASE.json` fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `schemaVersion` | Metadata schema version, initially `1` |
| `product` | Product name, `Maka` |
| `version` | Root `package.json` product version |
| `sourceCommit` | Exact source commit shared by every release artifact |
| `platform` / `architecture` | Artifact target, `macos` / `arm64` |
| `publicCommands` | Public command list; exactly `["maka"]` in Phase 1 |
| `node` | Official Node version, source URL, archive name, and archive SHA-256 |
| `npmVersion` | Exact npm version used to materialize the production closure |
| `dependencyPatches` | Sorted repository patches applied to the staged dependencies |
| `productionDependencies` | Sorted external `name@version` production closure |
| `thirdPartyNoticesSha256` | Digest binding notices to this artifact |
| `workspacePackages` | Sorted manifest-derived production workspace closure |
| `machOBinaries` | Sorted paths of every Mach-O file that must be signed and verified |
| `signing` | `developer-id-notarized` for release artifacts; `development` for local checks |

The CLI-specific `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt` must enumerate exactly the external production
dependencies recorded in `RELEASE.json`. The archive also carries the repository's
`DISCLAIMER-WIP`, `LICENSE`, `NOTICE`, and the pinned Node runtime license. The archive checksum is
generated only after signing and notarization complete.

Every Mach-O file inside the archive is signed and the ZIP is submitted to Apple's notary service.
ZIP files cannot carry a stapled notarization ticket, so the first Gatekeeper assessment on another
Mac may require network access to retrieve the ticket from Apple. The embedded code signatures and
published SHA-256 remain available for offline verification; do not describe the ZIP itself as
stapled.

## Release and installation boundary

Root `package.json` is the sole version authority. Desktop and CLI manifests must match before
packaging. Desktop, CLI/TUI, and source jobs build independently from one commit; one publish job
collects their verified outputs and creates one Draft GitHub Release.

The GitHub Release ZIP is the immutable standalone distribution source. npm keeps its
installer-specific tarball, OIDC, staged-publishing, and 2FA approval flow, but may start only after
the product `v<version>` tag and GitHub Release exist. It checks out that tag's exact commit and
derives the same version, runtime closure, file policy, notices, and source identity. It does not
create a tag or GitHub Release and does not block creation of the product Draft. Homebrew must
consume the standalone ZIP.

## Decision ledger

| Question | Decision | Enforced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which file owns the product version? | Root `package.json`; Desktop and CLI manifests must match it. | `product-release-identity.mjs` and release contract tests |
| Which event defines a product release? | One `v<version>` tag from `main`, one source commit, and one Draft GitHub Release. An interrupted Draft upload may retry only that exact commit. | `release.yml` identity and publish jobs plus the exact-tag helper |
| Which artifacts are required? | macOS and Windows Desktop installers, the macOS arm64 standalone CLI ZIP, and bundled source. | The publish job's required-file checks and trusted artifact-job outputs |
| Is npm another release authority? | No. It is an optional install channel whose Stage ref, source, workflow identity, and provenance all resolve to the existing product tag commit. | Tag-dispatched OIDC staging and read-only finalization; no npm-specific tag or GitHub Release |
| Does the standalone CLI define another package policy? | No. It derives the workspace closure, third-party pruning, notices, and Eval runtime assets from their current manifests and shared policy. | Packaging and artifact contract tests |
| Which commands are public? | `maka` only; TUI is its default mode. | CLI manifest, help tests, wrapper, and release metadata |
