/**
 * Session send projection — pure, sync answer to "will the next send on
 * this session succeed, silently rebind, or fail?". #1038.
 *
 * This is the single decision source shared by:
 *   - the desktop onboarding service, which resolves the async facts
 *     (connections, secrets) and calls this projection;
 *   - the renderer session health notice above the composer, which maps
 *     a `blocked` outcome to actionable copy.
 *
 * The logic mirrors the send path exactly:
 *   1. The session's own connection must pass `isConnectionReady` with
 *      the sticky session model.
 *   2. A locked session (has user messages) can never rebind — any
 *      failure of its own connection blocks the send.
 *   3. An unlocked session may silently rebind only for reasons in
 *      `shouldRebindSessionToDefault`; the walk tries the default
 *      connection first, then every other persisted connection.
 *   4. Otherwise the send is blocked.
 *
 * `lastTestStatus` deliberately plays no part here (E4): telemetry about
 * a past credential test must not gate send, so it must not gate the
 * notice's "send will fail" answer either.
