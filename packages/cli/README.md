# Maka CLI

[简体中文](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/blob/main/packages/cli/README.zh-CN.md)

Maka is a local-first agent workspace. The `maka-agent` npm package installs the interactive
terminal UI, the non-interactive CLI, Runtime Host tooling, and the Eval command.

> **Beta:** The CLI is under active development. Commands and local data formats may change before
> the stable release.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.19.0 or newer;
- a terminal with interactive input for the TUI;
- a configured model connection for agent turns; first-run setup currently supports API-key
  providers.

The release gate validates the following installed-package matrix:

| Platform | Architecture | Node.js | TUI, CLI, Runtime Host | Real Harbor/Pier Eval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | x64 | 22.19 | Validated | Preflight only |
| Linux | x64 | 24 | Validated | Validated |
| macOS | arm64 | 24 | Validated | Preflight only |
| Windows | x64 | 24 | Validated | Preflight only |

Other combinations that satisfy the Node.js minimum may work, but are not part of the current
release gate. Real Eval executor validation currently runs on Linux x64 with Node.js 24.

## Install

Install the current beta explicitly from the `next` dist-tag:

```sh
npm install --global maka-agent@next
maka --version
maka --help
```

The public command is `maka`. For a one-off invocation, use
`npx --yes --package maka-agent@next maka`; the unrelated `maka` package on npm is not this project.
`runtime-host service install` uses the persistent global installation above; `runtime-host setup`
creates its own managed copy from the exact package invoked by `npx`.

## First run

Start Maka from the project directory the agent should work in:

```sh
cd path/to/project
maka
```

If no model connection exists, Maka opens the provider setup flow. Select a provider, enter its API
key, choose the enabled models, and save. Run `/setup` later to add or update a provider and `/model`
to switch models.

API keys and workspace state stay in the local `Maka` profile. The current credential vault is a
local plaintext file protected by the operating-system account boundary; on POSIX systems Maka
enforces owner-only directory and file modes. It is not an OS keychain. See the repository
[security policy](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for the current
boundary.

Run one non-interactive turn with:

```sh
maka run "Summarize this project and identify its highest-risk area"
maka run --help
```

Maka asks before privileged tool operations by default. `maka run --yolo` grants the task full file
and network access and should only be used in an environment you are prepared to let the task
modify.

## Upgrade

While using prereleases, keep the `next` tag explicit:

```sh
npm install --global maka-agent@next
maka --version
```

Do not use a bare `npm update --global maka-agent` for beta upgrades: global npm updates follow the
`latest` tag and may select a different release line. After a stable release is available, install it
with `npm install --global maka-agent@latest`.

## Remote Runtime Host setup

To set up a persistent remote Runtime Host from an exact released package on Linux:

```sh
npx --yes --package maka-agent@next maka runtime-host setup \
  --principal my-client \
  --preset terminal-client
```

Rerunning setup replaces that Client credential. The service no longer depends on the temporary
`npx` cache after setup succeeds.

## Uninstall

```sh
# Linux only, when a managed Runtime Host service was installed
npx --yes --package maka-agent@next maka runtime-host service uninstall

# If Maka was installed globally
npm uninstall --global maka-agent
```

Remove the managed service before removing a global package so systemd does not retain a unit
pointing to the deleted CLI. Neither command deletes model connections, credentials, sessions, or
artifacts.
Those remain in the profile shared by the released CLI and Desktop app:

| Platform | Profile directory |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Maka` |
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Maka`, or `~/.config/Maka` when unset |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Maka` |

Back up and remove that directory separately only when you intend to delete all local Maka data.
Close the CLI and Desktop app first.

## Eval

Run a declarative experiment with:

```sh
maka eval run experiment.json --out .maka-eval/run-001
```

The npm package includes Maka's Eval runtime, relay, wrapper, and container policy assets. It does
not install the executor's external software or machine-local benchmark data. Before starting any
trial, Eval checks the exact prerequisites declared by the spec and fails without running a cell if
one is missing.

For Docker-based Harbor or Pier specs, provide:

- a reachable Docker CLI and daemon;
- a dedicated Python environment containing the exact framework version declared by
  `executor.config.frameworkVersion`;
- an executable interpreter through the environment variable named by `pythonPathEnv`;
- writable trial storage through `trialsRootEnv`;
- for Pier, the task directory named by `tasksRootEnv`;
- every machine path and subject credential environment variable declared by the spec.

Harbor and Pier must use separate Python environments. The currently validated versions are:

```sh
python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/maka-harbor-0.20.0
~/.venvs/maka-harbor-0.20.0/bin/python -m pip install 'harbor==0.20.0'

python3.12 -m venv ~/.venvs/maka-pier-0.3.0
~/.venvs/maka-pier-0.3.0/bin/python -m pip install 'datacurve-pier==0.3.0'
```

Set the spec's `pythonPathEnv` to the corresponding `bin/python` path. Do not reuse one environment
for both frameworks: their dependency and trial contracts differ. Advanced experiment and
toolchain details live in the
[Eval documentation](https://github.com/maka-agent/maka-agent/tree/main/packages/eval).

## Troubleshooting

Start by recording the installed versions:

```sh
node --version
npm --version
maka --version
```

- If `maka` is not found after a global install, ensure npm's global executable directory is on
  `PATH`.
- If no model is available, start the TUI and run `/setup`.
- If Eval refuses to start, follow the reported environment-variable name and expected framework
  version; it does not install or silently substitute missing prerequisites.
- When reporting a problem, include the three versions above, the operating system and
  architecture, the command, and the complete error with credentials removed.
